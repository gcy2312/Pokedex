# Pokedex
Pokedex js application:

The Pokedex app is a small web application which utilizes Javascript, CSS and HTML.
The application loads data from an external API, and allows users to interact by clicking on the name of a Pokemon, 
which triggers a dedicated modal dialog-box to open, and display specific details regarding that Pokemon.
Use of forEach() to ensure data for each Pokemon is only loaded once button is clicked (improved performance and 
load time).

The structure of the navigation bar and modal use Bootstrap 4 framework and custom CSS styling.

Dependencies:
Use of fetch and promise polyfills needed to load data from external API and parse JSON data
jQuery dependent for use of Bootstrap framework
